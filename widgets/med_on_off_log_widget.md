# Med On-Off Widget

The med on-off widgets is displayed in the [Stats screen](../screens/stats_screen.md) within a [Day stats widget](./day_stats_widget.md). It shows the periods of ons or offs as a bar with segments relative to the length of time periods.

The width is calculated from the screen width.
First, the time of medication is printen to the left and the duration until next dose is printed on the far right.

Then follows a colored bar with width relative to the duration, and an invisible box with a width of 100% of longest duration - total duration of this specific dose.
